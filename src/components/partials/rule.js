    <h3><strong>3.28.1.</strong><span> Basic concept</span></h3>
    <h4><strong>3.28.1.1.</strong><span> This game is played by betting on the numbers of the balls drawn from a bingo machine.</span></h4>
    <h4><strong>3.28.1.2.</strong><span> The Company will provide real time odds on the random draw of balls. You may place your bets based on such odds, in a variety of bet types as explained below.</span></h4>
    <h3><strong>3.28.2.</strong><span> Bet Types</span></h3>
    <h4><strong>3.28.2.1.</strong><span> Generally, two types of betting will be available for the Number Game.</span></h4>
    <h5><strong>(A)</strong><span> Pre-Games - Players may place bets before the game starts, but once the game starts no bets will allowed.</span></h5>
    <h5><strong>(B)</strong><span> Running games -  Players may place bets after the game starts and different odds will be given for every single ball drawn.</span></h5>
    <h3><strong>3.28.3.</strong><span> Bet Types</span></h3>
    <h4><strong>3.28.3.1.</strong><span> The pregame bet types are as follows:</span></h4>
    <h5><strong>(A)</strong><span> Over/Under, First ball drawn or last ball drawn</span></h5>
    <h5><strong>(B)</strong><span> Odd/Even, First ball or last ball drawn</span></h5>
    <h5><strong>(C)</strong><span> Odd/Even (FT) (sum of three balls drawn)</span></h5>
    <h5><strong>(D)</strong><span> Warrior, comparing Second ball drawn or Third ball drawn</span></h5>
    <h5><strong></strong><span> The “last ball drawn” is defined as the last of a pre-arranged number of bingo balls drawn.  If for any reason the last ball is not drawn, all bets on the last ball will be considered void and all the bets on the last ball will be refunded. </span></h5>
    <h5><strong></strong><span> Payouts are made only on complete games. A complete game is a game where the last ball is drawn without encountering any errors up to that point. In case errors are encountered, the Company reserves the right to void the game and refund the bets.</span></h5>
    <h4><strong>3.28.3.2.</strong><span> Over/Under, First ball drawn or last ball drawn</span></h4>
    <h4><strong></strong><span> The Company will offer odds on the number of 1st ball or last ball drawn being “over” or “under.”</span></h4>
    <h4><strong></strong><span> Over 1st/last– Ball number 38 to 75 is considered an Over ball.</span></h4>
    <h4><strong></strong><span> Under 1st/last– Ball number 1 to 37 is considered an Under ball.</span></h4>
    <h5><strong>Example: </strong><span> Ball number 30 was drawn as the last ball during the game therefore ‘Under’ bet wins.</span></h5>
    <h4><strong>3.28.3.3.</strong><span> Odd/Even, First ball or last ball drawn</span></h4>
    <h4><strong></strong><span> The Company will offer odds on the number of 1st ball or last ball drawn being “odd” or “even.” </span></h4>
    <h4><strong></strong><span> Odd – Odd numbered bingo ball is considered as the Odd ball.</span></h4>
    <h4><strong></strong><span> Even – Even numbered bingo ball is considered as the Even ball.</span></h4>
    <h5><strong>Example:</strong><span> Ball number 30 was drawn as the first ball during the game therefore ‘Even’ bet wins.</span></h5>
    <h4><strong>3.28.3.4.</strong><span> Odd/Even FT (sum of three balls drawn)</span></h4>
    <h4><strong></strong><span> The Company will offer odds on the sum of three balls drawn being an odd or even number.</span></h4>
